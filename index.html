            <p>I grew up and have lived in the Midwest my whole life. I guess Minnesotans don't really consider themselves Midwesterners but everyone in Minnesota thinks I'm from the south because I lived in Kansas. Kansas is not in the south. Its right in the middle of the country. Though anytime I go back to visit there, I seem to pick up a "southern accent". Its not an Alabama southern accent but its definitely not a Minnesota accent. I have now lived in Minnesota longer than anywhere else so I guess I am now more Minnesotan than anything.</p>
       

        
            <p>The picture to the left was taken in Portovenere, Italy. It's right on the coast of Italy and is just to the south of Cinque Terre. My wife and I went there and the end of our honeymoon in the summer of 2017. We did a whirlwind European honeymoon. It was 2 weeks but we managed to go to 6 different cities so it was long but we crammed in a lot of Europe. It was definitely the best trip of my life. I have had some really good trips before but this was my first as a husband and it made it that much better.

            <p>I attended the University of Kansas and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. I have worked in advertising, banking, retail, and printing since graduation, but nothing directly related to my degree. I still follow everything KU related even the football team even if they may be the worst D1 football in the country. You would think that a school that has one of the best basketball programs in the country could at least field a decent football team.
